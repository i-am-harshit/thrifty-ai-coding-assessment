# Longest K-Difference Subsequence

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest subsequence
such that the absolute difference between consecutive elements is at most **k**.

### Example

```text
Input:  arr = [1, 5, 3, 4, 2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: One valid subsequence is [1, 3, 4, 2]
```
